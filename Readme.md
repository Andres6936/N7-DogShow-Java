# Description

In a canine exhibition, parades of different canine races are made. For each of the
canine participants, the show manages the following information: name (which must
be unique for each participant), race, age and the number of points granted in the
exhibition.

Clients need an application that allows them to manipulate the information of the
participants in the dogs-show. In addition to the basic information, the photo of
each dog is also needed.

Application must (1) list the dogs registered in the exhibition, ordered by race,
points or age, (2) show the information of an specific dog, (3) register a new
dog, (4) find a dog by his name, (5) determine the winner of the exhibition
(the one that has the greatest assigned score), (6) determine the dog with the
smallest score and (7) determine the oldest dog among all (i.e. the one with
greatest age).
 
The initial information of the dogs is obtained from a properties file. When
program starts the execution, such information is loaded.
